>> **Note**: **Image update requires disassembling the system main control board inside the machine and taking out the SSD solid state drive on the back of the system main control board for update. Please do not disassemble the machine to update the image by yourself unless under special circumstances! ! !**

## 3 Verify the image

After burning the image to the NVME solid-state drive (SSD device), install it back to the main control board, connect the HDMI display, connect the development board power adapter (19V power supply), and then boot up. After successful booting, the system desktop is as follows:

If you want to verify the system version number, you can open a console terminal and execute the command: cat /etc/version. The terminal will output the system version number, for example: v1.0.0_250716

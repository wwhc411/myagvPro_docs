# Gazebo simulation

1. Start Gazebo simulation

```
ros2 launch agv_pro_description agv_pro_gazebo.launch.py
```

2. Use the keyboard node to control the simulation car

```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```

```
---------------------------
Moving around:
   u    i    o
   j    k    l
   m    ,    .

For Holonomic mode (strafing), hold down the shift key:
---------------------------
   U    I    O
   J    K    L
   M    <    >

t : up (+z)
b : down (-z)

anything else : stop

q/z : increase/decrease max speeds by 10%
w/x : increase/decrease only linear speed by 10%
e/c : increase/decrease only angular speed by 10%

CTRL-C to quit

currently:	speed 0.25	turn 0.5 
```
